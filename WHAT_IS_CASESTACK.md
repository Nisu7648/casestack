---

## 💡 **THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES**

### **Current Situation (Without CASESTACK):**

**CA Firm Example:**
```
Client: ABC Company - Tax Audit 2023-24

Files scattered everywhere:
❌ Excel sheet with case list
❌ Documents in email attachments
❌ Some files on WhatsApp
❌ Physical papers in cabinet
❌ No idea who reviewed what
❌ Can't find files when needed
❌ No proof of who did what
```

**Problems:**
1. **Lost Files** - "Where is that ITR file?"
2. **No Tracking** - "Did we review this case?"
3. **No Audit Trail** - "Who approved this?"
4. **Manual Work** - Excel sheets, manual follow-ups
5. **Security Risk** - Files on personal devices
6. **Compliance Issues** - No proof of review process
