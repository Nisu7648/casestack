# 🎯 Why Consulting Firms Should Adopt CaseStack

## The Problem: Consulting Firms Are Drowning in Tools

### Current Reality for Most Consulting Firms:

**15+ Disconnected Tools:**
1. **Excel** - Budget tracking, time sheets, risk registers
2. **Word** - Proposals, reports, contracts
3. **PowerPoint** - Client presentations
4. **Outlook/Gmail** - Email communication
5. **Asana/Trello** - Task management
6. **Harvest/Toggl** - Time tracking
7. **QuickBooks** - Invoicing
8. **Dropbox/Google Drive** - File storage
9. **Slack** - Team communication
10. **Zoom** - Video calls
11. **Notion** - Documentation
12. **Smartsheet** - Project planning
13. **Monday.com** - Workflow management
14. **Tableau** - Analytics
15. **Salesforce** - CRM

### The Pain Points:

❌ **Data Scattered Everywhere**
- Case information in 5 different places
- No single source of truth
- Constant context switching
- Information gets lost

❌ **Manual Work Everywhere**
- Copy-paste between tools
- Manual time entry
- Manual budget calculations
- Manual progress updates
- Manual report generation

❌ **Expensive**
- $50-200 per user per month across all tools
- $5,000-20,000/month for 10-person team
- $60,000-240,000/year wasted

❌ **Training Nightmare**
- New hires need to learn 15 tools
- 2-3 weeks onboarding time
- Constant questions and confusion

❌ **No Visibility**
- Partners can't see real-time status
- Budget overruns discovered too late
- Team utilization unknown
- Client satisfaction unclear
